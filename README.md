## Project Overview
**Cric-ETL** is an end-to-end data engineering project focused on processing IPL match data for analytics and machine learning-based match predictions. The project uses **Apache Airflow**, **PostgreSQL** to automate ETL workflows, store structured match data, and generate insights for an upcoming **dashboard**.

## Key Features
✅ **Automated ETL Pipeline** with Apache Airflow  
✅ **Google Drive Integration** for fetching IPL JSON data  
✅ **PostgreSQL Data Storage** with structured tables  
✅ **Feature Engineering** for predictive insights  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** (Planned) for match predictions  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard** (Planned) for data visualization  

## Tech Stack
- **Data Engineering**: Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, Pandas, Google Drive API  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost (or other ML models)  
- **Dashboard (Planned)**: Streamlit, Plotly, or BI tools
